					Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on March 25, 1947, in Pinner, Middlesex, England, to a middle-class family. His love for music began at an early age. When he was only four years old, he followed his mother's advice and began taking piano lessons. His natural talent eventually shone through, and Dwight won a scholarship with the Royal Academy of Music at age 11. While there, Dwight played with a couple of small rock bands like the Corvettes and Bluesology, but his dream of becoming a star led him to drop out of school shortly before graduation. He then embarked on a British tour with his Bluesology band mates and played the piano in different hotels. the meeting of a lifetime Although his success thus far was modest at best, Dwight's professional life changed dramatically after his meeting with lyricist Bernard Taupin. Dwight was becoming increasingly frustrated with the direction his band was headed and began looking for another group to join. Both he and Bernie answered an ad in the paper by Liberty Records, who were looking for new talent. The two quickly realized that they shared the same musical tastes and began writing songs together, though at first they only communicated by mail. By the time they actually met six months later, Dwight had adopted the stage name, Elton "Hercules" John, which he got by using the first names of his Bluesology mates, Elton Dean and John Baldry. John and Taupin were hired by producer Dick James to become staff songwriters for DJM records. Things got off to a slow start from there, as many of Elton's first singles -- along with his first album, Empty Sky -- went largely unnoticed. things took off Elton John's quest for recognition came to an end with the release of his self-titled sophomore album. Featuring the classic "Your Song," which became a hit in the US and UK, fans and critics alike became spellbound by this up-and-coming talent and songwriting team. The momentum was maintained with the release of Tumbleweed Connection and Elton John was on his way to becoming a worldwide superstar. John began touring in America in what became legendary shows, sporting outlandish costumes and giving electrifying performances. dominating the charts Sales continued to climb and between 1972 and 1975; John released 16 consecutive Top 20 hits, including "Bennie and the Jets," "Yellow Brick Road," and "Crocodile Rock," most of which have gone on to become pop classics. As if worldwide success wasn't enough, he was also featured on the cover of Time and in 1974, performed on stage at Madison Square Garden with John Lennon (Elton John later became godfather to Sean Lennon). John was now a rich man and the press had a field day digging into his private life, examining his wealth and his equally enormous purchases. elton's ups and downs In 1977, Elton's rigorous lifestyle caught up with him and citing exhaustion, announced that he would be taking a touring hiatus and limiting the production of music. His ties with Taupin were also severed and the two eventually called it quits. Though John made a comeback in 1979 (and became the first Western artist to perform in the Communist U.S.S.R.), the Elton/Taupin breakup affected the sales of his releases. It wasn't until they joined efforts again for 1981's 21 At 33 that John became successful again. The album contained the smash hit "Little Jeannie" and John had solidified his position as a pop icon. But the '80s were a tumultuous time for Elton: a cocaine and alcohol addiction, his marriage to sound engineer Renate Blauel in 1984, throat surgery, and a court battle with DJM over royalties all took center stage, despite pumping out hits like "I'm Still Standing" and "I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues." 1988 was a turning point in Elton John's life. It was then that he divorced his wife, opened up about his homosexuality, settled his legal disputes, and in the two years that followed, battled his addictions and bulimia. He also auctioned off thousands of his personal items, making the occasion symbolic in so many ways. the roaring '90s Elton John witnessed somewhat of a resurgence with the release of 1992's The One, which went double platinum. He also established the Elton John AIDS foundation in 1991, and announced that royalties would be donated to the cause. 1994 was a banner year; not only was he inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, but it was the year he and Tim Rice collaborated on the Lion King soundtrack, a blockbuster album which netted Elton an Oscar for Best Original Song for "Can You Feel The Love Tonight," as well as a Grammy for Best Male Pop Performance. All eyes were on Elton in 1997. Following the death of his close friend, designer Gianni Versace, in July, he grieved the loss of yet another close companion, Princess Diana. He sang a rewritten version of his "Candle in the Wind" to an estimated two billion people and gave a flawless performance. The record became the biggest-selling single of all-time, overtaking Bing Crosby's "White Christmas." That same year, Elton's The Big Picture became yet another commercial success and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998. By the start of the new millennium, Elton had collaborated with Tim Rice for the soundtrack of the successful Broadway musical (Aida), received the Legends Award at the 1999 Grammy Awards, and released yet another album (2001's Songs From the West Coast), with music that reflected his earlier styles. Elton John continues to fight for his charitable causes and shows no signs of slowing down.</div>
