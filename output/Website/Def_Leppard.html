					Def Leppard was formed by high school buddies Joe Elliott and Rick Savage in 1977. They were later joined by Steve Clark on guitar and Rick Allen on the drums. In early 1980 the band released their first album, On Through The Night. Later that year Def Leppard arrived in America to for many different bands including Judas Priest and AC/DC. Upon returning home the band found that the home town crowds had figure the band for sell outs to American money. They were not warmly greeted back. In 1981 the band teamed up with producer Ã¢â‚¬Å“MuttÃ¢â‚¬? Lang to record their second album High Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Dry. Later that year, a little know cable TV channel in America called MTV discovered the video for Brining On The Heartbreak and put it into their heavy rotation schedule. This helped the band sell a lot more records of High Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Dry. Phil Collen joined the band in 1982 for the recording of Pyromania. The single, Photograph, is released and is gobble up by the US fans for a total of 7 million copies. Unfortunately, the album doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do as well in the rest of the world. In 1984 near disaster strikes the band. On New Years Eve, Rick Allen losses control of his car and whips out in a ditch, severing his left arm. The doctors are unable to re-attach it. Rick, determined not to stop playing re-works a Simmons electronic drum kit so he can play it one-handed. In 1987 Def Leppard releases its biggest selling album ever, Hysteria. The album sells 16 million copies and seven of the twelve tracks are released as singles. They band are finally big stars in their own country. In 1991 guitarist Steve Clark dies from a mix of prescribed painkillers and alcohol. He is later replaced by Vivian Campbell, Ronnie James DioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former guitarist. Def Leppard go on to write many more albums including their newest, X, which was released in 2002.</div>
