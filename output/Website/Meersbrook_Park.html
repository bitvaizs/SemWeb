    	<div id="description">The leafy area of Meersbrook is an enormous and varied park with a bowling green, playground, wooded area, herb garden, walled flower garden and much more to keep you entertained. Meersbrook Park is situated on one of Sheffieldâ€™s seven hills and unparalleled views across the entire city are the reward for anyone brave enough to climb to the very top. Those less inclined to inclines can relax in the shade of the many gazebos and bandstands.</div>
