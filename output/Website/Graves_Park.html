    	<div id="description">Graves Park is Sheffield's largest Park and occupies over 200 acres on the southern edge of the city. The area is historic parkland and has existed as such for around 1000 years. It was saved from development by Alderman J.G.Graves, one of the city's major benefactors, who purchased the land between 1926 and 1936, and gifted it to the people of Sheffield as parkland forever.</div>
