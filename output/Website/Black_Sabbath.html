					Naming themselves after a 1930Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Boris Karlof movie Black Sabbath sprang to life out of a war devastated Birmingham, England country side. While the rest of the world was stilling singing about peace and flower, Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Terrance Ã¢â‚¬Å“GeezerÃ¢â‚¬? Butler and Bill Ward we conjuring up visions of witches and war councils. Peace and love were not found in there childhood and it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to be found in there music either. In 1970 they released their self titled album to the public. It was received so well it placed number 13 on the British charts. HowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that for coincidence? The haunting concoction of the vocals and the slightly muddy instruments made for instant hits. Later in 1970 Sabbath released Paranoid. This album gave to the world three of the biggest metal standards, the title track Paranoid, War Pigsand Iron Man. After many years of success, Black Sabbath started to hit some snags. Although all the members used drugs in some way, Ozzy eventually was abusing them to much for the rest of the bands liking. He was eventually fired and replaced by ex-Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Dio and Sabbath had great success with the albums Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules. After Dio left the band in 1982 the band never had the same success again. The group did get together for several reunions, like Live Aid and Ozzfest, but the band will never be the unit it was ever again.</div>
