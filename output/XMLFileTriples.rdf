            <j.0:hasBiography>At a time when pop was dominated by dance music and pop-metal, Guns N' Roses brought raw, ugly rock &amp; roll crashing back into the charts. They were not nice boys; nice boys don't play rock &amp; roll. They were ugly, misogynist, and violent; they were also funny, vulnerable, and occasionally sensitive, as their breakthrough hit, "Sweet Child O' Mine," showed. While Slash and Izzy Stradlin ferociously spit out dueling guitar riffs worthy of Aerosmith or the Stones, Axl Rose screeched out his tales of sex, drugs, and apathy in the big city. Meanwhile, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler were a limber rhythm section who kept the music loose and powerful. Guns N' Roses' music was basic and gritty, with a solid hard, bluesy base; they were dark, sleazy, dirty, and honest -- everything that good hard rock and heavy metal should be. There was something refreshing about a band who could provoke everything from devotion to hatred, especially since both sides were equally right. There hadn't been a hard rock band this raw or talented in years, and they were given added weight by Axl Rose's primal rage, the sound of confused, frustrated white trash vying for his piece of the pie. As the '80s became the '90s, there simply wasn't a more interesting band around, but owing to intra-band friction and the emergence of alternative rock, Rose's supporting cast gradually disintegrated, as he spent several years in seclusion. Guns N' Roses released their first EP in 1986, which led to a contract with Geffen; the following year, the band released their debut album, Appetite for Destruction. They started to build a following with their numerous live shows, but the album didn't start selling until almost a year later, when MTV started playing "Sweet Child o' Mine." Soon, both the album and single shot to number one, and Guns N' Roses became one of the biggest bands in the world. Their debut single, "Welcome to the Jungle," was re-released and shot into the Top Ten, and "Paradise City" followed in its footsteps. By the end of 1988, they released G N' R Lies, which paired four new, acoustic-based songs (including the Top Five hit "Patience") with their first EP. G N' R Lies' inflammatory closer, "One in a Million," sparked intense controversy, as Axl Rose slipped into misogyny, bigotry, and pure violence; essentially, he somehow managed to distill every form of prejudice and hatred into one five-minute tune. Guns N' Roses began work on the long-awaited follow-up to Appetite for Destruction at the end of 1990. In October of that year, the band fired Adler, claiming that his drug dependency caused him to play poorly; he was replaced by Matt Sorum from the Cult. During recording, the band added Dizzy Reed on keyboards. By the time the sessions were finished, the new album had become two new albums. After being delayed for nearly a year, the albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II were released in September 1991. Messy but fascinating, the albums showcased a more ambitious band; while there were still a fair number of full-throttle guitar rockers, there were stabs at Elton John-style balladry, acoustic blues, horn sections, female backup singers, ten-minute art rock epics with several different sections, and a good number of introspective, soul-searching lyrics. In short, they were now making art; amazingly, they were successful at it. The albums sold very well initially, but while they had seemed destined to set the pace for the decade to come, that turned out not to be the case at all. Nirvana's Nevermind hit number one in early 1992, suddenly making Guns N' Roses -- with all of their pretensions, impressionistic videos, models, and rock star excesses -- seem very uncool. Rose handled the change by becoming a dictator, or at least a petty tyrant; his in-concert temper tantrums became legendary, even going so far as to incite a riot in Montreal. Stradlin left by the end of 1991, and with his departure the band lost their best songwriter; he was replaced by ex-Kill for Thrills guitarist Gilby Clarke. The band didn't fully grasp the shift in hard rock until 1993, when they released an album of punk covers, The Spaghetti Incident?; it received some good reviews, but the band failed to capture the reckless spirit of not only the original versions, but their own Appetite for Destruction. By the middle of 1994, there were rumors flying that the band was about to break up, since Rose wanted to pursue a new, more industrial direction and Slash wanted to stick with their blues-inflected hard rock. The band remained in limbo for several more years, and Slash resurfaced in 1995 with the side project Slash's Snakepit and an LP, It's Five O'Clock Somewhere. Rose remained out of the spotlight, becoming a virtual recluse and doing nothing but tinkering in the studio; he also recruited various musicians -- including Dave Navarro, Tommy Stinson, and ex-Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck -- for informal jam sessions. Remaining members were infuriated by Rose's inclusion of childhood friend Paul Huge in the new sessions when both Stradlin and Clarke were excluded from rejoining the band. And a remake of the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil" was essentially the straw that broke the camel's back, as Rose cut out some of the other member's contributions and pasted Huge over the song without consulting anyone else. By 1996 Slash was officially out of Guns N' Roses, leaving Rose the lone remaining survivor from the group's heyday; rumors continued to swirl, and still no new material was forthcoming, though Rose did re-record Appetite for Destruction with a new lineup for rehearsal purposes. The first new original G N' R song in eight years, the industrial metal sludge of "Oh My God" finally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film End of Days. Soon after, Geffen issued the two-disc Live Era 1987-1993. 2000 brought the addition of guitarists Robin Finck (of Nine Inch Nails) and Buckethead. 2001 was greeted with Guns N' Roses' first live dates in nearly seven years, as the band (who consisted of Rose plus guitarists Finck, Buckethead, bassist Stinson, former Primus drummer Brian Mantia, childhood friend and guitarist Paul Huge, and longtime G N' R keyboardist Dizzy Reed) played a show on New Years Eve 2000 in Las Vegas, playing as well at the mammoth Rock in Rio festival the following month. A new album was announced for a summer release, but the date came and went without any CDs hitting the shelves. A summer tour of Europe was planned, but before tickets could go on sale Rose announced that the tour was cancelled and the band went into seclusion until New Years Eve of 2001. They played almost the exact same set as the year before, but they still managed to brew up some news by not allowing any former members to watch the show. Slash tried to get onto the guest list, and even claims to have tried to sneak in through a security guard. Manager Doug Goldstein released a statement taking full responsibility for the banning of former members, claiming that he was not sure of their intentions and he wanted to avoid making Rose nervous. 2002 started with no new Axl news, instead seeing former members Slash, Duff, and Izzy work together on new material for Stradlin's new album. Rose eventually ended up in music news as he fired producer Roy Thomas Baker from the group's newest recording sessions, adding him to the superstar list of producers that had been attached to the project at various points (including Moby, Mike Clink, Youth, Bob Ezrin, and many others.) Slash's contributions to Izzy's album didn't make the final cut, but rumors of a new band featuring former members McKagan, Sorum, and Slash began circulating by the end of the spring. A slew of Japanese and British festival dates were set in the spring, but the mysterious new album continued to elude fans as the release date was pushed into the fall of 2002. Before those concert dates rolled around, guitarist Paul Huge left the group, quickly replaced by former Love Spit Love member Richard Fortus. An appearance at MTV's annual Video Music Awards helped garner interest in the new lineup, but a rusty performance from Rose and an interview where he said his new album wasn't coming out anytime soon didn't do much to further their cause. That summer, the band started on their first tour in almost eight years, and they managed to fulfill all of their commitments in Europe in Asia. Sadly, they caused a violent and destructive riot in Vancouver when Rose failed to show up for the first date of their North American tour. Tour openers CKY were especially inconvenienced, as Rose had only asked them days before to reroute from California to Canada for the show. A few shows managed to come together, with Rose hitting the stage quite late at certain dates. But Rose didn't show up for a Philadelphia concert after allowing both opening acts to go on beforehand. The costly vandalism that followed the announcement was enough to convince tour backers Clear Channel to cut their ties with the group, ending the tour and convincing CKY to verbally thrash the group on their website. While he was up to his old shenanigans with the retooled lineup, former members Stradlin, Slash, Sorum and McKagan finally put an end to the rumors and announced that they were searching for a vocalist for a new, Axl-free band. The years between albums have grown into a running joke in the music industry, Interscope's frustration with the millions dumped into the recording has become secondary to Rose's reclusive insistence to perfect his material. By leaving the industry on such a strong note, Rose's image has been frozen in time as the frustrating, angry, yet sensitive genius behind the microphone, an image he might not be ready to live up to as the years go by. Despite what happens to most groups that have stayed out of the limelight for ten years, the legend of Guns N' Roses continues to grow with each year. Whatever may happen with the new lineup, the five original members continue to enjoy celebrity status despite having their post-GN'R material show less than enthusiastic sales. By writing one of the most critical hard rock albums of all time, they have secured their status as the most vital force to hit the mainstream rock scene in the 80's.</j.0:hasBiography>

            <j.0:hasBiography>A rather conceptual indie band -- one that's been compared more than once to Joy Division -- British Sea Power is a quartet from Brighton, England, comprising members named Hamilton, Noble, Yan, and Wood. Formed in late 2000, their live shows began to receive notice early on, thanks in no small part to the large stuffed birds that perched on stage and the militaristic uniforms worn by the band members. Rough Trade's Geoff Travis was taken aback by one of the group's (literally) wild performances and signed them; by the end of 2001, they had two singles in the racks: Fear of Drowning on Golden Chariot and Remember Me on Rough Trade. After an amazing showcase at SXSW in 2003, British Sea Power prepped for the fall release of The Decline of British Sea Power.</j.0:hasBiography>

                <j.0:hasBiography>Skid Row was one of the last hair metal bands to hit the mainstream before grunge took over in the early '90s. They were also arguably the last of such bands to have any originality. While their 1989 self-titled release used standard pop-metal riffs and contained a handful of generic lyrics, 1991's Slave to the Grind and 1995's Subhuman Race broke away from the pop-metal mold with uncharacteristically hard, thrashy guitars and more unique songwriting while still relying on varying '80s metal formulas. Though personal differences and changing trends would eventually tear the band apart by 1996, Skid Row showed a tremendous amount of promise during their short run in the mainstream. Skid Row was formed in 1986 by bassist Rachel Bolan and former Bon Jovi guitarist Dave "the Snake" Sabo. The pair added guitarist Scotti Hill, drummer Rob Affuso, and vocalist Sebastian Bach to the lineup by early 1987 and the band spent the next year and a half playing a series of local clubs in the eastern U.S. Still in connection with Jon Bon Jovi, Sabo convinced the established rock star to land Skid Row a record deal with Mercury. In 1989, the band released their first album, Skid Row, which went multi-platinum on the strength of the Top 40 singles "18 and Life" and "I Remember You." Success was not without backlash, however -- the band had naively signed away much of their royalties and Sebastian Bach's childlike behavior would land the group in additional trouble. During the subsequent tour, Bach received harsh criticism for a T-shirt he publicly sported displaying the message: AIDS KILLS FAGS DEAD. Suits were also filed against Bach after a concert during the supporting tour, where the singer allegedly threw a glass bottle into the crowd, injuring a young female fan. Nonetheless, Skid Row retained a devoted audience -- 1991's Slave to the Grind debuted at number one on the Billboard Charts, an unprecedented accomplishment for a metal band. While the album did not chart any real radio hits, Grind received stronger critical praise and would eventually reach platinum status. Like so many of their peers, Skid Row lost much of their fan base during the grunge phase of the '90s. As Nirvana stormed the scene in 1992, Skid Row took a hiatus, waiting out the grunge period and pondering breakups (ironically, Nirvana had once gone under the name Skid Row in the '80s). Skid Row returned in 1995 with Subhuman Race, which surprisingly charted in the Top 40 but otherwise did not attract any real attention. During the supporting tour, tensions between the group members ran high and Skid Row disbanded shortly afterwards. Bach went on to form the Last Hard Men with Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, but the group broke up after recording a cover of Alice Cooper's "School's Out" for the Scream soundtrack in 1996. Plans to record new songs for the Skid Row greatest hits album, 1998's Forty Seasons, fell through, as Bach went on to form a solo project and portray the title role in the Broadway musical Jeckyll and Hyde. In mid-2000, Skid Row reformed with new singer Johnny Solinger and toured as the opening band for KISS' Farewell Tour.</j.0:hasBiography>

                <j.0:hasBiography>A protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of Dr. Dre, rapper Eminem emerged in 1999 as one of the most controversial rappers to ever grace the genre. Using his biting wit and incredible skills to vent on everything from his unhappy childhood to his contempt for the mainstream media, his success became the biggest crossover success the genre had seen since Dre's solo debut seven years earlier. The controversy over his lyrics was the best publicity any musician could afford, and being the first Caucasian rapper to make a significant impact in years may have given him a platform not afforded to equally talented African-American rappers. A gifted producer as well, his talents always seemed overshadowed by his media presence, which was a mix between misunderstood genius and misogynistic homophobe. Both may be true, but his message spoke to legions of disaffected youth who had few role models in the rap world who could relate to the white lower-class experience. He was born Marshall Mathers in St. Joseph, MO (near Kansas City), spending the better part of his impoverished childhood shuttling back and forth between his hometown and the city of Detroit. Initially attracted to rap as a teen, Eminem began performing at age 14, performing raps in the basement of his high school friend's home. The two went under the names Manix and M&amp;M (soon changed to Eminem), which Mathers took from his own initials. Due to the unavoidable racial boundaries that came with being a white rapper, he decided the easiest way to win over underground hip-hop audiences was to become a battle rapper and improv against other MCs in clubs. Although he wasn't immediately accepted, through time he became such a popular attraction that people would challenge him just to make a name for themselves. His uncle's suicide prompted a brief exodus from the world of rap, but he returned and found himself courted by several other rappers to start groups. He first joined the New Jacks, and then moved on to Soul Intent, who released Eminem's first recorded single in 1995. A rapper named Proof performed the B-side on the single and enjoyed working with Eminem so much that he asked him to start yet another group. Drafting in a few other friends, the group became known as D-12, a six-member crew that supported one another as solo artists more than they collaborated. The birth of Eminem's first child put his career on hold again as he started working in order to care for his family. This also instilled a bitterness that started to creep into his lyrics as he began to drag personal experiences into the open and make them the topic of his raps. A debut record, 1996's Infinite, broke his artistic rut but received few good reviews, as comparisons to Nas and AZ came unfavorably. Undaunted, he downplayed many of the positive messages he had been including in his raps and created Slim Shady, an alter ego that was not afraid to say whatever he felt. Tapping into his innermost feelings, he had a bounty of material to work with when his mother was accused of mentally and physically abusing his younger brother the same year. The next year his girlfriend left him and barred him from visiting their child, so he was forced to move back in with his mother, an experience that fueled his hatred toward her and made him even more sympathetic toward his brother. The material he was writing was uncharacteristically dark as he began to abuse drugs and alcohol at a more frequent rate. An unsuccessful suicide attempt was the last straw, as he realized his musical ambitions were the only way to escape his unhappy life. He released the brutal Slim Shady EP, a mean-spirited, funny, and thought-provoking record that was light years ahead of the material he had been writing beforehand. Making quite the impression in the underground not only for his exaggerated, nasal-voiced rapping style but also for his skin color, many quarters dubbed him the music's next "great white hope." According to legend, Dr. Dre discovered his demo tape on the floor of Interscope label chief Jimmy Iovine's garage, but the reality was that Eminem took second place in the freestyle category at 1997's Rap Olympics MC Battle in Los Angeles and Iovine approached the rapper for a tape afterward. It wasn't until a month or two later that he played the tape for an enthusiastic Dre, who eagerly contacted Eminem. Upon meeting, Dre was taken back by his skin color more than his skill, but within the first hour they had already started recording "My Name Is." Dre agreed to produce his first album and the two released "Just Don't Give a Fuck" as a single to preview the new album. A reconciliation with his girlfriend led to the two getting married in the fall of 1998, and Interscope signed the rapper and prepared to give him a massive push on Dre's advice. An appearance on Kid Rock's Devil Without a Cause only helped the buzz that was slowly surrounding him. The best-selling Slim Shady LP followed in early 1999, scoring a massive hit with the single and video "My Name Is," plus a popular follow-up in "Guilty Conscience"; over the next year, the album went triple platinum. With such wide exposure, controversy ensued over the album's content, with some harshly criticizing its cartoon-ish, graphic violence; others praised its edginess and surreal humor, as well as Eminem's own undeniable lyrical skills and Dre's inventive production. In between albums, Eminem appeared on Dre's Dr. Dre 2001, with his contributions providing some of the record's liveliest moments. The Marshall Mathers LP appeared in the summer of 2000, moving close to two-million copies in its first week of release on its way to becoming the fastest-selling rap album of all time. Unfortunately, this success also bred more controversy, and no other musician was better suited for it than Eminem. Among the incidents that occurred included a scuffle with the Insane Clown Posse's employees in a car stereo shop, a bitter battle with pop star Christina Aguilera over a lyric about her fictional sexual exploits, a lawsuit from his mother over defamation of character, and an attack on a Detroit club goer after Eminem allegedly witnessed the man kissing his wife. Fans ate it up as his album stood strong at the top of the charts. But the mainstream media was not so enamored, as accusations of homophobia and sexism sprung from the inflammatory lyrics in the songs "Kill You" and "Kim." It was this last song that ended his marriage, as the song's chosen topic (violently murdering his real life wife Kim Mathers) drove his spouse to a suicide attempt before they divorced. Eminem toured throughout most of this, settling several of his court cases and engaging a mini-feud with rapper Everlast. The annual Grammy Awards nominated the album for several awards, and to silence his critics the rapper called on Elton John to duet with him at the ceremony. In 2001, he teamed with several of his old Detroit running buddies and re-formed D-12. Releasing an album with the group, Eminem hit the road with them that summer and tried to ignore the efforts of his mother, who released an album in retaliation to his comments. After getting off of the road, he stepped in front of the camera and filmed 8 Mile, a film loosely based on his life directed by the unlikely fan Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys). His constant media exposure died out as well, leaving him time to work on new music. When he re-emerged in 2002, he splashed onto the scene with "Without Me," a single that attacked Moby and Limp Bizkit and celebrated his return to music. Surprisingly, the following album, The Eminem Show, inspired little controversy. Instead, the popular second single "Cleanin' Out My Closet" told of his dysfunctional childhood and explained his hatred toward his mother in a mannered, poignant fashion. And being Eminem, he followed this up with an appearance at MTV's Video Music Awards that inspired boos when he verbally assaulted Moby for no apparent reason</j.0:hasBiography>

                <j.0:hasBiography>Herbie Mann, credited as being one of the seminal jazz flutists, is probably best known for the musical odyssey that has taken him around the world. Long before the concept "world music" was coined, he was exploring the rhythms and harmonies of Africa, India, Cuba, Jamaica, the Middle East and Japan. But the country whose music has most influenced his playing and most touched his heart is Brazil - more about this later. Herbie was born in Brooklyn, New York, on April l6, l930, as Herbert Jay Solomon. He expressed his love of music by using the only resources available -- pots and pans. In an attempt to pacify disgruntled neighbors, his mother tried to rechannel his musical interests by taking him to a Benny Goodman concert at the Paramount when he was nine years old. It worked and two weeks later he had a clarinet. Though the academics of music were never appealing to Herbie, his love of playing and music were what turned his focus eventually to the tenor saxophone and later to the that instrument with which he's been so identified, the flute. By fourteen he was playing tenor at gigs in the Catskills and in l948 he entered the US Army where he spent nearly four years in Trieste, Italy, playing with the 98th Army Band. Herbie Mann PictureOnce he was out of the Army and back on the New York music scene, he worked hard at carving out a place for himself. However, like so many other tenor saxophone players of that time, Herbie's style was derivative of Lester Young's so it was difficult to stand out from the rest. When the Dutch accordionist, Mat Matthews, told him he was looking for a jazz flute player for the first album by the then unknown Carmen McRae, Herbie immediately jumped at the opportunity and spent days "woodshedding" before going into the studio. With this opportunity he was able to distinguish himself from other players as a jazz flutist, of which there were only a handful. Herbie Mann PictureHerbie's reputation as a flutist took a distinctive turn in l958, when he followed legendary jazz DJ Symphony Sid Torin's suggestion that he add a conga player to his group. This added rhythmic element boosted Herbie's popularity and the list of Latin percussionists who played with him in the late 50's and 60's reads like a Who's Who of the genre: Candido, Ray Barretto, Olatunji, Potato Valdes, Willie Bobo and others. Audiences around the world loved this sound. It was during this period that he recorded the legendary HERBIE MANN AT THE VILLAGE GATE album and did a month long tour of Africa for the State Department. Despite his increased popularity, Herbie felt frustrated by the simplicity of the Latin and African melodies and the monotony of their rhythms. So, in l961 when he heard about a tour of American players going to Brazil, he convinced his manager, Monty Kay, that he had to go, too. This experience changed his musical life more than any other experience before or since. At last here were complex, beautiful melodies supported by compelling rhythms! Herbie Mann PictureOne trip wasn't enough so soon after his return he convinced his record company, Atlantic, to sponsor an extended visit to Brazil to record his next album. On this trip he met many of Brazil's then emerging musical talents including Sergio Mendes, Antonio Carlos Jobim, and Baden Powell. His ensuing releases, DO THE BOSSA NOVA WITH HERBIE MANN and HERBIE MANN/JOAO GILBERTO/ANTONIO CARLOS JOBIM helped usher in the Bossa Nova craze. These were the first recordings made that combined Brazilian musicians and their music with an American jazz player. Soon thereafter, Brazilian music was ubiquitous and Herbie found himself in search of new inspiration. Atlantic albums like NIRVANA with Bill Evans, IMPRESSIONS OF THE MIDDLE EAST, THE WAILING DERVISHES, REGGAE, MEMPHIS UNDERGROUND, and PUSH PUSH document his search for new sounds. Herbie Mann PictureWhen the disco craze hit, Herbie figured, "Why not?" He made three "disco" albums on Atlantic and one of the songs, "High Jack" went Top Ten. This "pop" -ularity was scorned by many of the purists and Herbie found himself out of favor with most of the Jazz community. When Herbie's attention reverted back again to the more satisfying Brazilian music, he was no longer able to sustain the kind of sales he had established with his "pop" albums. His refusal to stay in that genre and Atlantic's unhappiness with the new sales resulted in the termination of their 20 year relationship in l980. He was on his own and the absence of corporate support proved difficult for his career. He signed with two record companies that went Chapter 11 and went through several musical constellations that were ultimately unsatisfying and unsuccessful. CD CoverHowever, towards the end of this ten-year period, he formed a group, Jasil Brazz, and once again reestablished his musical footing in the fertile sounds of his beloved Brazil. He produced two records, JASIL BRAZZ and OPALESCENCE featuring Brazilian guitarists Romero Lubambo and Ricardo Silveira. Throughout the label "shifts", he retained his rights to these recordings and in l992 formed his own label, Kokopelli Music. He launched the label with the release of DEEP POCKET - an all star, soul/jazz recording featuring Les McCann, Cornell Dupree, David Newman and Chuck Rainey. CD CoverTwo years later, Herbie went into a partnership and Kokopelli Music was expanded to Kokopelli Records. This year and a half venture produced nearly a dozen recordings including Herbie's PEACE PIECES, a tribute to the music of Bill Evans, featuring guitarist Bruce Dunlap, Eddie Gomez and Randy Brecker. Herbie is no longer in partnership with Kokopelli. Herbie's career is enjoying a renewed level of appreciation. In the late 50's, Herbie began a thirteen-year run as DOWNBEAT'S Number One Flutist. Though years since passed with little "formal" acknowledgement, his name is once again being highlighted. In 1996 and 1997, he was voted Number One Jazz Flutist in JAZZIZ and Number Two in JAZZ TIMES magazines. CD CoverAfter nearly 60 years of living in New York City, Herbie moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, the "Land of Enchantment", in 1989. He shares a wonderful life there with his wife, Susan Janeal Arison, an actress and writer. Herbie released two albums on the Lightyear label from his l995 weeklong celebration of his 65th birthday. The recordings, "Celebration" and "America Brasil" feature many of his longtime friends and musical partners from his past, including David "Fathead" Newman, Dave Valentin, Ron Carter, Billy Taylor, Tito Puente, Randy Brecker, Claudio Roditi and others. CD CoverSince 1998, Herbie has been writing music for his new group, Sona Terra. The music reflects the rhythms and feelings of Eastern Europe, his roots. The new group includes: Gil Goldstein on accordion and keyboards; Paul Socolow on bass; Bruce Dunlap on guitar; Geoff Mann (HerbieÃ¢s younger son) on drums, mandolin and percussion; and Alexander Federiouk, cymbilum. In 1997, Herbie was diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer. He has received radiation and chemotherapy treatments and at this writing is doing well. Out of his experience has come the desire to help spread awareness about the deadly disease and its very easy detection and prevention.

            <j.0:hasBiography>Naming themselves after a 1930Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Boris Karlof movie Black Sabbath sprang to life out of a war devastated Birmingham, England country side. While the rest of the world was stilling singing about peace and flower, Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Terrance Ã¢â‚¬Å“GeezerÃ¢â‚¬? Butler and Bill Ward we conjuring up visions of witches and war councils. Peace and love were not found in there childhood and it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to be found in there music either. In 1970 they released their self titled album to the public. It was received so well it placed number 13 on the British charts. HowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that for coincidence? The haunting concoction of the vocals and the slightly muddy instruments made for instant hits. Later in 1970 Sabbath released Paranoid. This album gave to the world three of the biggest metal standards, the title track Paranoid, War Pigsand Iron Man. After many years of success, Black Sabbath started to hit some snags. Although all the members used drugs in some way, Ozzy eventually was abusing them to much for the rest of the bands liking. He was eventually fired and replaced by ex-Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Dio and Sabbath had great success with the albums Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules. After Dio left the band in 1982 the band never had the same success again. The group did get together for several reunions, like Live Aid and Ozzfest, but the band will never be the unit it was ever again.</j.0:hasBiography>

                <j.0:hasBiography>Rock &amp; roll wild child Avril Lavigne hit big in summer 2002 with her spiky-fun debut song "Complicated," shifting pop music into a different direction. Lavigne, who was 17 at the time, didn't seem concerned with the glamor of the TRL-dominated pop world and such confidence allowed her star power to soar. The middle of three children in small town Napanee, Ontario, Lavigne's rock ambitions were noticeable around age two. By her early teens, she was already writing songs and playing guitar. The church choir and local festivals and county fairs also allowed Lavigne to get her voice heard, and luckily, Arista Records' main man Antonio "L.A." Reid was listening. He offered her a deal, and at 16, Lavigne's musical dreams became reality. With Reid's assistance and a new Manhattan apartment, Lavigne found herself surrounded by prime songwriters and producers, but it wasn't impressive enough for her to continue. She had always relied on her own ideas to create a musical spark and things weren't going as planned. Lavigne wasn't disillusioned, though. She headed for Los Angeles and Nettwerk grabbed her. Producer/songwriter Clif Magness (Celine Dion, Wilson Phillips, Sheena Easton) tweaked Lavigne's melodic, edgy sound and her debut, Let Go, was the polished product. Singles such as "Complicated" and "Sk8er Boi" went top 10 while "I'm With You" and "Losing Grip" did moderately well at radio. Butch Walker of the Marvelous 3, Our Lady Peace frontman Raine Maida and Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Good Charlotte) signed on to produce Lavigne's second album. Under My Skin appeared in May 2004.</j.0:hasBiography>

    <j.0:hasDesription>Rivelin Valley is a woodland valley in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The River Rivelin runs through the valley. Rivelin possesses many ponds, testament to the twenty mills which were once present on the river. Famous mills are the Hind Wheel and the Rivelin Corn Mill, the former dating from 1581 and the latter, 1600. The most well known, Mousehole Forge at Malin Bridge, produced the famous anvils. Some mills were in activity up until the 1950s.</j.0:hasDesription>

                <j.0:hasBiography>Def Leppard was formed by high school buddies Joe Elliott and Rick Savage in 1977. They were later joined by Steve Clark on guitar and Rick Allen on the drums. In early 1980 the band released their first album, On Through The Night. Later that year Def Leppard arrived in America to for many different bands including Judas Priest and AC/DC. Upon returning home the band found that the home town crowds had figure the band for sell outs to American money. They were not warmly greeted back. In 1981 the band teamed up with producer Ã¢â‚¬Å“MuttÃ¢â‚¬? Lang to record their second album High Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Dry. Later that year, a little know cable TV channel in America called MTV discovered the video for Brining On The Heartbreak and put it into their heavy rotation schedule. This helped the band sell a lot more records of High Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Dry. Phil Collen joined the band in 1982 for the recording of Pyromania. The single, Photograph, is released and is gobble up by the US fans for a total of 7 million copies. Unfortunately, the album doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do as well in the rest of the world. In 1984 near disaster strikes the band. On New Years Eve, Rick Allen losses control of his car and whips out in a ditch, severing his left arm. The doctors are unable to re-attach it. Rick, determined not to stop playing re-works a Simmons electronic drum kit so he can play it one-handed. In 1987 Def Leppard releases its biggest selling album ever, Hysteria. The album sells 16 million copies and seven of the twelve tracks are released as singles. They band are finally big stars in their own country. In 1991 guitarist Steve Clark dies from a mix of prescribed painkillers and alcohol. He is later replaced by Vivian Campbell, Ronnie James DioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former guitarist.

                <j.0:hasBiography>Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on March 25, 1947, in Pinner, Middlesex, England, to a middle-class family. His love for music began at an early age. When he was only four years old, he followed his mother's advice and began taking piano lessons. His natural talent eventually shone through, and Dwight won a scholarship with the Royal Academy of Music at age 11. While there, Dwight played with a couple of small rock bands like the Corvettes and Bluesology, but his dream of becoming a star led him to drop out of school shortly before graduation. He then embarked on a British tour with his Bluesology band mates and played the piano in different hotels. the meeting of a lifetime Although his success thus far was modest at best, Dwight's professional life changed dramatically after his meeting with lyricist Bernard Taupin. Dwight was becoming increasingly frustrated with the direction his band was headed and began looking for another group to join. Both he and Bernie answered an ad in the paper by Liberty Records, who were looking for new talent. The two quickly realized that they shared the same musical tastes and began writing songs together, though at first they only communicated by mail. By the time they actually met six months later, Dwight had adopted the stage name, Elton "Hercules" John, which he got by using the first names of his Bluesology mates, Elton Dean and John Baldry. John and Taupin were hired by producer Dick James to become staff songwriters for DJM records. Things got off to a slow start from there, as many of Elton's first singles -- along with his first album, Empty Sky -- went largely unnoticed. things took off Elton John's quest for recognition came to an end with the release of his self-titled sophomore album. Featuring the classic "Your Song," which became a hit in the US and UK, fans and critics alike became spellbound by this up-and-coming talent and songwriting team. The momentum was maintained with the release of Tumbleweed Connection and Elton John was on his way to becoming a worldwide superstar. John began touring in America in what became legendary shows, sporting outlandish costumes and giving electrifying performances. dominating the charts Sales continued to climb and between 1972 and 1975; John released 16 consecutive Top 20 hits, including "Bennie and the Jets," "Yellow Brick Road," and "Crocodile Rock," most of which have gone on to become pop classics. As if worldwide success wasn't enough, he was also featured on the cover of Time and in 1974, performed on stage at Madison Square Garden with John Lennon (Elton John later became godfather to Sean Lennon). John was now a rich man and the press had a field day digging into his private life, examining his wealth and his equally enormous purchases. elton's ups and downs In 1977, Elton's rigorous lifestyle caught up with him and citing exhaustion, announced that he would be taking a touring hiatus and limiting the production of music. His ties with Taupin were also severed and the two eventually called it quits. Though John made a comeback in 1979 (and became the first Western artist to perform in the Communist U.S.S.R.), the Elton/Taupin breakup affected the sales of his releases. It wasn't until they joined efforts again for 1981's 21 At 33 that John became successful again. The album contained the smash hit "Little Jeannie" and John had solidified his position as a pop icon. But the '80s were a tumultuous time for Elton: a cocaine and alcohol addiction, his marriage to sound engineer Renate Blauel in 1984, throat surgery, and a court battle with DJM over royalties all took center stage, despite pumping out hits like "I'm Still Standing" and "I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues." 1988 was a turning point in Elton John's life. It was then that he divorced his wife, opened up about his homosexuality, settled his legal disputes, and in the two years that followed, battled his addictions and bulimia. He also auctioned off thousands of his personal items, making the occasion symbolic in so many ways. the roaring '90s Elton John witnessed somewhat of a resurgence with the release of 1992's The One, which went double platinum. He also established the Elton John AIDS foundation in 1991, and announced that royalties would be donated to the cause. 1994 was a banner year; not only was he inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, but it was the year he and Tim Rice collaborated on the Lion King soundtrack, a blockbuster album which netted Elton an Oscar for Best Original Song for "Can You Feel The Love Tonight," as well as a Grammy for Best Male Pop Performance. All eyes were on Elton in 1997. Following the death of his close friend, designer Gianni Versace, in July, he grieved the loss of yet another close companion, Princess Diana. He sang a rewritten version of his "Candle in the Wind" to an estimated two billion people and gave a flawless performance. The record became the biggest-selling single of all-time, overtaking Bing Crosby's "White Christmas." That same year, Elton's The Big Picture became yet another commercial success and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998. By the start of the new millennium, Elton had collaborated with Tim Rice for the soundtrack of the successful Broadway musical (Aida), received the Legends Award at the 1999 Grammy Awards, and released yet another album (2001's Songs From the West Coast), with music that reflected his earlier styles. Elton John continues to fight for his charitable causes and shows no signs of slowing down.</j.0:hasBiography>

                <j.0:hasBiography>Just months after Coldplay released their #1 debut album, Parachutes, in England, they were hailed as Band of the Year 2000 in the music press. How did these four college friends become the poster children for a nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotions? It may have happened at the speed of light, but it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as easy as it seems. Coldplay secured a permanent position in BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music elite by writing beautiful, simple songs that gently pulled at the heartstrings of a nation. Somewhere in between the confident, vulnerable guitar playing of Jonny Buckland, the melodic bassline of Guy Berryman, thoughtful drumming of Will Champion, and lead Chris MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stark, tenor vocals are answers for the soul. Although melancholy stands behind every Coldplay song, each one is also steeped in an unusual and sincere optimism rarely found in English bands. Songs face an inevitable sadness and yearning Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a little thing called being real Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to get to a better place where the truth held firm in pure emotion is pivotal. Songs like the remorseful Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trouble,Ã¢â‚¬? with its memorable piano-line, the lonely Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpiesÃ¢â‚¬? and mega-hit single Ã¢â‚¬Å“YellowÃ¢â‚¬? reveal a hybrid of lyrics that can only be described as joy and remorse, all wrapped into one. "We just want the songs to reflect reality," says Chris. In doing so, Coldplay may well be the most profound British act to emerge out of the millennium thus far. No one is more surprised by their popularity than the band. Who knew such an austere and tactile musical existence would lead to such greatness? Yet it has. It all began when the members of Coldplay met in 1996 - their first week of college (University College London). Two and a half years later, they had their first official band session - a rehearsal in JonnyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bedroom in January of 1998. Jonny and Chris had been working on songs since they met, but the other two members hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really been around much until Guy joined the band to play bass just before dropping out of engineering school. The other two stuck with their studies, while also pursuing music. Will, also still in school, loved playing guitar but was persuaded to become ColdplayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drummer so the band could play their first gig (at a Cuban CafÃƒÂ© at a festival for unsigned bands called Ã¢â‚¬Å“In The CityÃ¢â‚¬? in Manchester) in late 1998. They had just six songs written including Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t PanicÃ¢â‚¬? and Ã¢â‚¬Å“High SpeedÃ¢â‚¬? - now found on Parachutes. They soon released 500 copies of an EP called Safety (financed by their now manager, Phil) and released the single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brothers And SistersÃ¢â‚¬? on a small English label called Fierce Panda, after which the UK label Parlophone signed them in 1999 just before final exam time. As they say, the rest is history, or in the stars, or whatever. In any case, another EP on Parlophone, The Blue Room, followed, as did the single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shiver.Ã¢â‚¬? -more- Before the band, lead singer/guitarist/pianist Chris Martin grew up in a close family from Devon, England. In fact, he still lives at home as the eldest of five kids raised by a teacher mum and accountant dad, where he started bashing out tunes on the family piano at an early age. Typical of the first-born, he is an over-achiever and self-proclaimed worrier. Although anything to do with Ã¢â‚¬Å“injusticeÃ¢â‚¬? will rile him up, no one can accuse him of being the typical tortured and drunken English musician since he rarely drinks, never smokes and admits life can be pretty damn good. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shy product of boarding school where he soon graduated to the guitar and has been in bands since the age of 15. He considers the big three in music to be: Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Tom Waits. Oh, and the Flaming Lips arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bad either. Lead guitarist Jonny Buckland doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very good guitar player, but the rest of the world begs to differ. He was born 22 odd years ago in London, then his family relocated to Mold, North Wales when he was just four. Jonny first picked up a guitar at the tender age of 11, encouraged by his older brother who was a huge My Bloody Valentine fan. Both boys grew up in a house filled with Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix from their dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record collection. Yet it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until Jonny discovered The Stone Roses that he started taking the guitar seriously. People describe him as shy and nonchalant, but he argues heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just happy to be quiet. Bassist Guy Berryman was born in Scotland, although his family later moved to Kent, England where he started to collect rare groove and funk records when all the other kids were into indie rock. He started playing bass at age 13 and is still inspired by a love of those early records. Words like Ã¢â‚¬Å“calm,Ã¢â‚¬? Ã¢â‚¬Å“reliableÃ¢â‚¬? and Ã¢â‚¬Å“enthusiasticÃ¢â‚¬? are used to describe drummer Will Champion. He was born in Southampton, England to teacher parents who encouraged him to spend his formative years learning to play a variety of instruments including guitar, bass, piano and the tin whistle. He had never played drums before joining Coldplay but was so musically inclined that he quickly caught on. Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very quiet and very wise,Ã¢â‚¬? says Chris about Will. Ã¢â‚¬Å“As a musician, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got the most amazing sense of melody. He can play just about anything Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and he can do little impressions. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good at entertaining people.Ã¢â‚¬? When the band went into the studio early last year with co-producer and engineer Ken Nelson to record Parachutes, they agreed that nothing would go on the album that they all four didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t agree on. This led to a fierce and gut wrenching recording session that the guys thought might be their last. Songs ended up veering from fragile to forceful, from understated to epic, all-the-while carried by ChrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gorgeous vocal range and endearingly bashful lyrics. On a bittersweet morning in May, the album was finished. No one predicted that just a short time later, Parachutes would debut at #1 and continue to hover in the Top Ten Charts for the remainder of the year. The band was also nominated for an esteemed Mercury Music Prize, received the Q Award for Best Album and signed to an American label (Nettwerk America/Capitol). Chris admits that the last track on the album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“EverythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not Lost,Ã¢â‚¬? is the message of ColdplayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire work up until now. The song says that when things happen to you in life, your first inclination is to think everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terrible, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the point? Then you realize the point is simply that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that bad and you have to keep going. Finally, you come to realize that life is good. Look for Coldplay to embark on their first-ever American tour in the beginning of 2001.</j.0:hasBiography>

Smiths, Arctic Monkeys create a vibrant punk-inspired sound well suited for Britpop and alternative rock fans alike. Alex Turner (vocals/guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Andy Nicholson (bass), and Matt Helders (drums) formed Arctic Monkeys in Sheffield, England, in 2003. A year prior, Turner and Cook received guitars for Christmas. From there, these teenagers made practicing an obsession, memorizing hits by the White Stripes and the Vines. A deal with Domino, the label home to Franz Ferdinand and Clinic, followed in spring 2004. Rambunctious first single "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" debuted at number one on the U.K. singles chart in October 2005. Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, was issued in January 2006; within a day of its release, the album sold 118,501 copies in the U.K., setting a record for more records sold than the rest of the Top 20 album chart combined.</j.0:hasBiography>

    <j.0:hasDesription>The leafy area of Meersbrook is an enormous and varied park with a bowling green, playground, wooded area, herb garden, walled flower garden and much more to keep you entertained. Meersbrook Park is situated on one of Sheffield’s seven hills and unparalleled views across the entire city are the reward for anyone brave enough to climb to the very top. Those less inclined to inclines can relax in the shade of the many gazebos and bandstands.</j.0:hasDesription>

            <j.0:hasBiography>Formed from the ashes of toner rock icons Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age reunited the group's singer/guitarist Josh Homme, drummer Alfredo Hernandez, and bassist Nick Oliveri along with new guitarist/keyboardist Dave Catching. The project's origins date back to Homme, who in the wake of Kyuss' 1995 demise relocated to Seattle to tour with the Screaming Trees; he soon began working with a revolving lineup of musicians including the Trees' Van Conner, Soundgarden's Matt Cameron, and Dinosaur Jr.'s Mike Johnson, recording a series of 7"s originally issued under the name Gamma Ray. After rechristening the group Queens of the Stone Age, Homme recruited Hernandez to begin work on their self-titled debut LP, issued in late 1998 on Loosegroove; after the album was completed, Oliveri left the Dwarves to re-join his former bandmates, with the subsequent addition of Catching rounding out the roster. In addition to extensive touring, Homme put together a series of albums for the indie label Man's Ruin; the various volumes of The Desert Sessions feature Homme's collaborations with a loose-knit, revolving-door lineup of like-minded musicians, some from bands like Soundgarden, Fu Manchu, and Monster Magnet. In mid-2000, Queens of the Stone Age issued their sophomore album, R (as in the movie rating; some promo copies were distributed with the original title, "II"), before appearing on that year's Ozzfest tour. By that point, drummer Hernandez had been replaced by a tag-team combo of Gene Troutman and Nicky Lucero. The group built a healthy buzz courtesy of accolades from such renowned publications as Rolling Stone, and due to good-old-fashioned touring. 2001 saw the group perform at the massive Rock in Rio festival (after which Oliveri was arrested by the Brazilian police for performing nude) and a spot on the year's Ozzfest. The same year, Homme and Oliveri put together yet another volume of the Desert Sessions series, while QOTSA assembled a third studio album. Ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl was very vocal in the press about his admiration of the Queens, which led to an invitation for him to join the group for the third album's recording and, subsequently, supporting tour. Surprisingly, Grohl accepted, putting the Foo Fighters on hold (despite having a new album completed and ready to go). One of the year's most eagerly anticipated ard rock albums, Songs for the Deaf was issued in August of 2002, and was preceded by a tour that saw Oliveri and Homme joined by Grohl on drums, ex-Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan, and A Perfect Circle guitarist/keyboardist Troy Van Leeuwen. As if their schedules weren't busy enough between QOTSA and their other projects, Oliveri and Homme signed on to pen the musical score to the movie The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (with backing by Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk), and formed a new project, Headband, with ex-Marilyn Manson bassist Twiggy Ramirez and Amen frontman Casey Chaos.</j.0:hasBiography>

    <j.0:hasBiography>Glasgow's art-damaged rock quartet Franz Ferdinand -- named for the Austro-Hungarian Archduke whose murder sparked World War I -- features bassist Bob Hardy, guitarist Nick McCarthy, drummer Paul Thomson, and singer/guitarist Alex Kapranos. In late 2001, Kapranos and Hardy had begun working on music together when they met McCarthy, a classically trained pianist and double bass player who originally played drums for the group despite no prior experience as a drummer. The trio had been rehearsing at McCarthy's house for a while when they met and started playing with Thomson, a former drummer for the Yummy Fur who felt like playing guitar instead. Eventually, McCarthy and Thomson switched to guitar and drums, and the band switched practice spaces, stumbling upon an abandoned warehouse that they named the Chateau. The Chateau became Franz Ferdinand's headquarters, where they rehearsed and held rave-like events incorporating music and art (Hardy graduated from the Glasgow School of Art, and Thomson also posed as a life model there). The bandmembers needed a new rehearsal space once their illicit art parties were discovered by the police, and they found one in a Victorian courthouse and jail. By summer 2002, they recorded an EP's worth of material that they intended to release themselves, but word of mouth about the band spread and Franz Ferdinand signed to Domino in the summer of 2003. The group's EP Darts of Pleasure, which led some to label Franz Ferdinand "the Scottish Interpol," was released that fall, and the band spent the rest of the year supporting groups such as Hot Hot Heat and Interpol itself. Franz Ferdinand's second single, Take Me Out, arrived in early 2004. The single propelled them to greater popularity in the UK and laid the groundwork for the band's debut album. Franz Ferdinand was released in February 2004 in the UK and a month later Stateside. Franz Ferdinand's success followed them across the pond; "Take Me Out" became a sizeable modern rock hit, in part thanks to the song's cutting-edge video, which earned the Breakthrough Video award at that year's MTV Music Video Awards. The group's momentum continued with the release of the Michael single and their Mercury Prize win over such artists as the Streets, Basement Jaxx and Keane. Franz Ferdinand released their second album, You Could Have it So Much Better ... with Franz Ferdinand in fall 2005. ~ Heather Phares, All Music Guide</j.0:hasBiography>
